A guide to hacking on objective:

RETRIEVING THE SOURCE CODE
--------------------------

ObjectiveAccounts is maintained in an Darcs repository. If you haven't used
Darcs before, you'll find it an extraordinarily easy to use, powerful, and full
featured distributed revision control system. You can learn more at
http://www.darcs.net

You can fetch the source code by doing the following:

	darcs get http://research.operationaldynamics.com/darcs/objective/
	cd objective
	./configure
	make

This will build Java bytecode classes. As a convenience,

	make pop

will compile the classes and run objective in a standard Java Virtual Machine.
(At the moment this executes a wrapper which loads some sample data and then
initializes the various windows so that the the results of the code can be
visually inspected).

Before you do that, you should do

	make test

which will run the unit tests, an excellent way to make sure your installation
is complete and that things are working correctly. You'll need JUnit for this.
In fact, at the moment, configure requires the junit jars be present, so you
might as well run the unit tests! (FIXME)

[Oh, one thing that Darcs does that's a bit silly is that it doesn't
automatically mark scripts as executable. So you may have to

	chmod +x configure

first. You can avoid this if you use the --set-scripts-executable option with
the `darcs get` command, or if you add "get --set-scripts-executable" to a file
called ~/.darcs/defaults . I'm hoping upstream will change this to be the
default behaviour]


PREREQUISITES
-------------

ObjectiveAccounts is written in Java and uses uses:

* java-gnome	Bindings around the GTK and GNOME libraries
		http://java-gnome.sourceforge.net

* junit		Unit testing framework for Java
		http://www.junit.org


CONFIGURATION
-------------

The top level directory contains a custom ./configure which detects your
Operating System variant, sets defaults accordingly, verifies the location of
prerequisites (the various jars files), and finally chooses a Java bytecode
compiler and Java virtual machine runtime environment.

Your configuration is persistent across builds in that checkout - ie, `make
clean` won't force you to reconfigure (though `make distclean` will). The
configure script runs very quickly, so it's no big deal if you have to re run
it. The configuration output is a makefile fragment which is written to .config
and subsequently included by the top level Makefile.

You can override the choices configure makes by listing parameters on the
command line, like this:

	./configure compiler=gcj runtime=gij

This facilitates easily switching between runtimes and compilers for testing.
At the moment, the available selections are:

* compiler ->	javac, jikes, gcj

* runtime  ->	java, gij, kaffe

* quiet		(don't output anything)

Right now, Gentoo Linux and Fedora Core 4 are fully configured, and Debian is
getting there. If you are running a different operating system or distribution,
please contact us and we'll add it - it's just a matter of identifying the
location of a few things. Better yet, look in the configure Perl script - the
places where OS is switched are obvious, and just add what you need to add.

The whole point of configure is to figure things out for you, but if it can't
quite figure out where Java is, you can override it by specifying an alternate
location to find a JDK and/or GCJ, using either of the following:

* jdk_home		(where to find a traditional Java Development Kit,
			 ie JAVA_HOME)

* gcj_home		(location of an alternate GCJ install)

* java-gnome_home	(prefix of an alternate java-gnome install)

For example:

	./configure jdk_home=/opt/sun-jdk-1.4.2.04 java-gnome_home=/opt/gnome2

If you're having trouble with something as Make runs and need to debug it, you
can try:

	V=1 make

which will show you the actual commands being executed by Make (ie, Make's
normal behaviour, which we override for appearances sake).


A NOTE ABOUT GCJ GENERATED NATIVE CODE
--------------------------------------

ObjectiveAccounts has been built with GCJ compatibility in mind. The amazing
thing about GCJ is that in addition to being able to generate class files (the
-C argument), it can generate native object code! We have every intention of
distributing objective as a native executable using gcj.

Linking gcj compiled java sources against other jars which are its prerequisite
dependencies can be tricky.

One other gotcha is that gcj doesn't have the same sophistication with respect
to finding and automatically compiling source code that javac does. With javac,
you can just list the top level class and, recursively, all of its dependencies
will be scanned and if necessary compiled. This is a huge savings since you
don't have to do an invocations of javac for each source file, thus avoiding
the time penalty of firing up each javac (and more to the point, the Java VM it
runs in)

The implication of this, though, is that doing something straight forward like

	find src -name '*.java'

to get the list of source files to feed to GCJ doesn't work: it picks up *all*
the source files, and so anything in the tree that is incomplete or worse has
experimental dependencies on things that may not be available on your system
will cause the native build step to fail.


In due course, make will automatically build both classes and native files; the
command

	make build/native

will build the native code using GCJ.


RUNNING IN ECLIPSE
------------------

One of the significant reasons to ensure that the program still builds and runs
with a conventional Java VM is so that it can be worked on in Eclipse.

To run in eclipse, I had to do LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib /opt/eclipse/eclipse
which is a touch annoying - not sure what I'm missing there.


CONTRIBUTING
------------

I would welcome contributions back. If you'd like to do so, please either
follow the code formatting conventions you see, or use something like Eclipse
to autoformat things, (write me and I'll send you the format description file).

In any event, please contact me and we'll talk about the best way to send
patches. Given that darcs is a fully distributed version control system, if you
are intending to make a contribution, you can prepare patches by committing
them to your local working copy, and then using darcs send to generate an email
with the your patches as they differ from those recorded in the repository you
originally fetched from:

	darcs record
	darcs send --to=andrew@operationaldynamics.com  http://research.operationaldynamics.com/darcs/objective/

Darcs has an awesome ability to cherry pick patches, both in terms of composing
the changes you wish to record as a patch, and in selecting what you send to
[accept from] an external repository. Run:

	darcs changes

to get the idea.

One final note: I'd prefer patches that are complete and comprehensive; one
liner bug fixes are fine when necessary (ie, if that's all it is) but if, say,
you're adding support for a new distro to configure, record it as one complete
patch rather than 5 small ones. For trivial fixes, just use a one line patch
name; for more comprehensive patches please add a long comment (in addition to
the patch name) when darcs offers you the chance.


DIRECTORY LAYOUT
----------------

%	doc		Documentation, including user docs, programmer
			APIs (javadocs) and examples.

	share		Common files necessary for Client UI and/or Server
			versions. Glade files, DTDs...

	src		Source files. Java.


*	tests		Unit tests. Hierarchy of packages follows src/

*+%	build		stamp files and other artifacts of build process (the
			name is used largely because it makes the top level
			Makefile really nice, ie targets like "build/classes"

*+%	tmp		Output directory used during unit tests

*+%	tmp/classes	Output directory for compiled classes

*+%	tmp/native	building & linking binary versions

Key:

* Does not need to be distributed at all (in source or binary form)

+ Temporary directories. They may not exist (ie, tmp/ is populated during
  unit tests). If they do exist, they do not need to be distributed
  and can be deleted at will.

% Some or all files herein may be generated - ie, javadocs don't need to be
  in VCS, but probably want to exist prior to shipping a release.
