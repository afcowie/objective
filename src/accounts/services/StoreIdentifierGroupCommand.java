 * their containing IdentifierGroup are imdepotent and so we can leverage our
 * underlying DataClient's magic create & update being the same operation.
 * <p>
 * Note that if you've removed an Identifier from an IdentifierGroup and use
 * this to persist it, the Identifier itself is NOT removed from the
 * DataClient. This is because it could be in use and will be required as a
 * legacy reference. If you're really trying to delete the identifier itself,
 * use DeleteIdentifierCommand.
