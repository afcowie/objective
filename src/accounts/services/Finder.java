/**

 * Although the API is a touch more cumbersome that it coule be (eg, static
 * methods might tighten it up), once a finder is instantiated it can be used
 * repeatedly with minor tweaks to search parameters - both in the sense of
 * SQL bind variables and in the sense of being able to cache intermediate
 * results as appropriate.
