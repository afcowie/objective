/**
 * The top of the command hierarchy. These classes are the distinct operations
 * that cause changes to be made to the underlying domain model (ie, the
 * command pattern). <BR>
 * <B>COMMAND OBJECTS ARE NOT COMMITTED TO THE DATABASE</B>
 * <P>
 * Commands underlie the user interface. Any user interface that updates the
 * domain will use a Command object to do so. While this is slightly
 * cumbersome in terms of parallel classes, it means that the commands can be
 * fully validated through unit tests separate from the logic to translate
 * from UI to equivalent domain changes. The Command hierarchy is in the
 * services layer because they use the persistence layer directly to find and
 * store domain objects.
 * <P>
 * Unlike the domain model, we do not use a deep tree here. While immediate
 * subclasses like NewCommand and UpdateCommand and DeleteCommand are
 * tempting, many commands will have aspects of both New <I>and</I> Update.
 * Being able to identify one over the other is a bit meaningless.
 * <P>
 * With luck Commands will be undoable via a stack, but that implies that they
 * are able to hold a complete description of the previous state. Obviously we
 * could do this if we held a copy of the <i>entire</i> domain object tree,
 * but that is really rather excessive. On the other hand, only carrying the
 * prior state of objects we know we touched implies that we know the
 * implications of what each of those touches are - frought with possibility
 * of error.
