/**
 * Update an existing Transaction already stored in the database. This is a
 * tricker case than PostTransactionCommand because of the fact that in
 * addition to having modified Entry objects, the Transaction object being
 * passed to save() may well have new Entry objects (no biggie) but equally
 * ones that have been removed. If we don't delete these they will become
 * orphans - unlike a live VM garbage collecting unreachable objects, unused
 * objects are not arbitrarily removed from the persistence store!
 * <p>
 * The following is assumed: a client or ui layer class making modifications
 * to a Transaction and asking UpdateTransactionCommand to persist these
 * changes <b>must call Transaction.removeEntry() and addEntry() for Entries
 * that are not simply being modified</b>.
 * <p>
 * This Command will then:
 * <ul>
 * <li>remove the Transaction's old Entries reducing the balances in the
 * various Ledgers to which they bridged.
 * <li>Add the new Entries to the parent Ledgers,
 * <li>then update the Transaction by calling DataClient.save().
 * </ul>
