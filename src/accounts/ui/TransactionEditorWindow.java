/**
 * Transactions all have in common that they are either creating a new
 * Transaction or editing an existing on. In the former case,
 * PostTransactionCommand must be called, in the latter,
 * UpdateTransactionCommand is used. Both operate on generalized Transaction
 * objects and so it is feasible to abstract up common functionality.
 * <p>
 * Certain workaround have been necessary, notably doing the save and commit
 * calls to the database in a worker Thread. This is somewhat verbose code, so
 * we do it here in ok(), which subclasses are expected to call after they
 * have populated the transaction they are operating on.
 * <p>
 * The constructors pass straight through to EditorWindow. If a database id is
 * specified, the object is fetched and the TransactionEditorWindow marks
 * itself as editing.
