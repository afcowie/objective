/**
 * A simple wrapper, as the {@link org.gnu.gtk.MessageDialog} class (which is

 * <p>
 * Instantiate the dialog then call {@link #run()} to show &amp; block, or
 * {@link #present()} just to show it. It will center on the screen.

 * Example of use:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ModalDialog error = new ModalDialog(window, &quot;File not found&quot;, e.getMessage() + &quot;\n&quot; + &quot;Try again?&quot;,
 *         MessageType.WARNING);
