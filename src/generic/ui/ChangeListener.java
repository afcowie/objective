/**
 * Report a change in one of our mutator Widgets that occured as a result of
 * user action. The premise of this Listener interface is that its
 * userChangedData() method is fired at the end of a Widget's regular event
 * Listeners when they handle <code>CHANGED</code> signals but only as a
 * result of direct user data changes, which we take to be when the Widget in
 * question
 * <ol>
 * <li>has focus
 * <li>isn't blank/null
 * </ol>
 * There is no necessity for Widgets using this Listener to maintain a
 * registry of multiple sets of them. One is sufficient, especially as the
 * whole point of using this Listener is to work around the problem of
 * multiple invokations that happen when reacting to GTK events signals.
