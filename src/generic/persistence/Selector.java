/**
 * Wrap the db4o Native Query mechanism. Mostly because that class is really
 * messy, and partly so that services classes do not have to do db4o specific
 * imports. Originally named this "NativePredicate", but given that an
 * anonymous instance of this is the argument to
 * {@link DataClient#nativeQuery(Selector)}, that seemed overly verbose.
 * "Selector" seems a good alternative.
 * <p>
 * Concrete anonymous classes must implement a method `boolean match()` with a
 * single argument: a typed parameter all instances of which will be iterated
 * over, fed to match(), and included in query result if true is returned.
