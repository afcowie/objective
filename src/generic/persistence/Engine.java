/**
 * A static class providing a global reentry point to manipulating an
 * accounting database file. Provides methods and holders to:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Create or open a database within a DataServer, holding it as a
 * reference as singleton to be used by the rest of the application.
 * <li>Get a reference to the primary DataClient connection to that is used
 * for read-only purposes.
 * <li>Execute a clean shutdown of the persistence system.
 * </ul>
 * The bulk of uses of this class will be of the form:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Engine.openDatafile(&quot;blah.yap&quot;);
 * 
 * DataClient ro = Engine.primaryClient();
 * DataClient rw = Engine.gainClient();
 * // ...
 * Engine.releaseClient(rw);
 * 
 * Engine.shutdown();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The primary reference can be fetched out as often as you want. No need to
 * return it.
 * 
 * Providing gainClient() and releaseClient() is somewhat of a duplication,
 * since these merely pass through to DataServer, but it makes the singleton
 * static API a little easier to use. That Engine wraps a DataServer is
 * transparent, other than your having to ensure you shutdown safely.

/*
 * This class is separate from the accounts.client.ObjectiveAccounts primary
 * program client to provide better reuse and reduce clutter. A much more
 * tempting fit would be to merge this classes behaviour into
 * accounts.persistence.DataServer; after all this is all static and would not
 * interfere with the instance code in DataServer. True enough, but there is
 * the possiblity (on upgrade, perhaps?) that we will someday need to have
 * multiple databases open simultaneously so leave DataServer as the instance
 * wrapper around an ObjectServer, and use this class to hold the static
 * singleton references that the bulk of the UI will use directly.
